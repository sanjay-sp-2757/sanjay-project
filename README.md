NSL-KDD Intrusion Detection Dataset

Overview
This project uses the **NSL-KDD dataset**, a widely used benchmark dataset for **intrusion detection** and **network attack classification**.  
The dataset contains various types of network traffic records labeled as *normal* or different categories of attacks such as DoS, Probe, R2L, and U2R.

Purpose
The goal of this project is to analyze, preprocess, and prepare the NSL-KDD dataset for intrusion detection research.  
It serves as a foundation for building machine learning or deep learning models that can detect and categorize network attacks.

Contents
- **Dataset cleaning and preprocessing notebook**
- **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
- **Attack category distribution and feature inspection**
- **Prepared dataset for further modeling**

What the Notebook Does
- Loads the NSL-KDD dataset  
- Cleans and standardizes features  
- Converts categorical features to usable format  
- Maps attack types into broader categories  
- Prepares the dataset for training and evaluation  

Requirements
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Common data-analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib  

About NSL-KDD
The NSL-KDD is an improved version of the KDD’99 dataset, designed to remove duplicate records and provide a more balanced and realistic evaluation of intrusion detection systems.
